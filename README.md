# Cracking the Coding Interview - Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to coding problems from the book **Cracking the Coding Interview** by Gayle Laakmann McDowell, and from CoderByte.com.
The goal is to practice algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques to prepare for technical interviews.

## üìö About the Book

_Cracking the Coding Interview_ is a widely used resource for software engineers preparing for technical interviews. It covers a wide range of coding problems and solutions, categorized by topics such as arrays, linked lists, recursion, dynamic programming, and more.

## üö® Disclaimer

All solutions in this repository are entirely my own. I have not referred to any external sources, solutions, or hints while solving the problems. The intent is to strengthen my problem-solving skills by approaching each problem independently.

## üõ†Ô∏è Structure of the Repository

Each problem is separated into its own `.py` file and includes the problem description. The solutions are written in **Python**, with the time complexity mentioned as a comment at the end of each code file.

## üîë Key Concepts Covered

- Arrays and Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees and Graphs
- Recursion and Dynamic Programming
- Sorting and Searching
- Object-Oriented Design
